# GCRC: A Gyro-Controlled RC Car

## About

- GCRC is a project I made that utilizes gyroscopic data from an MPU6050 module and sends it via ESP32 bluetooth to an RC car that's controlled by an Arduino board.
- C++

## Features

- **Remote Controlled Car -** Includes a 4-wheel remote controlled car.
- **Motion Control -** The RC car is controlled using a gyroscopic device strapped to your hand.
- **Bluetooth Communication -** The RC car and gyroscopic device communicates through bluetooth for seamless real-time control and data transmission.

## Hardware Modules

- **Arduino Uno R3 -** RC car microcontroller
- **ESP32-WROOM-32 -** Glove microcontroller
- **MPU6050 -** Accelerometer/Gyroscope
- **L298N -** Motor driver
- **HC-05 -** Bluetooth receiver
- **DC Motors**
- **RC Car Chassis**
- **3.7V 3400mAh 18650 Li-ion Batteries**
- **6V Li-Po Battery**
