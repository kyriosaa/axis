## Features

- **Remote Controlled Car -** Includes a 4-wheel remote controlled car.
- **Motion Control -** The RC car is controlled using a gyroscopic device strapped to your hand.
- **Bluetooth Communication -** The RC car and gyroscopic device communicates through bluetooth for seamless real-time control and data transmission.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP32 -** Car & Glove microcontroller
- **MPU6050 -** Accelerometer/Gyroscope
- **L298N -** Motor driver
- **DC Motors**
- **RC Car Chassis**
- **3.7V 3400mAh 18650 Li-ion Batteries**
- **1.5V AA Alkaline Batteries (or equivalent)**
