# GCRC

## About

- GCRC is a project I made that utilizes gyroscopic data from an MPU6050 module and sends it via ESP32 bluetooth to an RC car that's controlled by an Arduino board.
- Code written in C++

## Features

- **Remote Controlled Car:** Includes a 4-wheel remote controlled car.
- **Motion Control:** The RC car is controlled using a gyroscopic device strapped to your hand.
- **Bluetooth Communication:** - The RC car and gyroscopic device communicates through bluetooth for seamless real-time control and data transmission.
